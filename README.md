# FOCUS
FOCUS is an Android app that deals with mobile phone addiction, helps with time management, and provides recommendations 
based on usage statistics and your current goals.

## Why FOCUS
The idea originated from an observation/user pain that people, especially younger generations, find themselves spending too much
time on electronics such as phones nowadays. The call for self-discipline and quality of life is the core value that differentiates
FOCUS from other similar products in the market. The crucial feature of FOCUS is to set up goals, which will facilitate users tackle
challenges and fight against their "unwanted" habits.
